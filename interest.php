			<p>Most of my time is spent doing chores, Yardwork, Home Projects, cooking, and settling sibling rivelry;
				but once I get a moment of free time I retreat to my Gaming PC.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I also make sure to have a book at hand when I just want to relax. My goal is to read a few pages a day.
